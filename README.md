# Jaguar Movement GPS data
--------------------------------------------------------
***Morato R. et al (see all the co-authors below): Jaguar Movement Database: a GPS-based movement dataset of the apex predator in Neotropics.***

Apex predators are facing dramatic population decline and contraction of geographic range (Estes et al. 2011, Ripple et al. 2014). The jaguar (*Panthera onca*) has been extirpated from 55% of its historical range and most of its subpopulations throughout Latin Americaare now classified as Endangered or Critically Endangered (De La Torre et al. 2017). Anthropogenic changes to the landscape, either through habitat loss or fragmentation, is amajor threat for the species’ long-term persistence as it directly impacts individual movement and space use (Colchero et al., 2011; Conde et al., 2010; De La Torre etal., 2017; Morato et al., 2016).

Movement is akey behaviour for the survival of non-sessile species, including securingaccess to food and water, evasion from predators and competitors, and reproduction(Morales et al. 2010). Consequently, disrupting animal movement natural patterns can have important implications forecosystem dynamics and function, including disturbances to food webs andnutrient cycling processes (Allen and Singh 2016). Thus, acomprehensive analysis of animal space use and movement is crucial to understandingthe mechanisms driving species ecology and ecosystem functions.

This dataset represents the first joint effort of over than 35 jaguar experts to make this information freely available. We are assuming that either retaliation or poaching will not be favored by this data set. In contrast to this logic, we anticipate that this dataset will be invaluable for future research, to answer specific questions about jaguar ecology that will ultimately have a strong impact for the species long-term survival. A total of 117 individuals were monitored within Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, México and Paraguay between 1999 and 2016. 

All data will be available in ECOLOGY repository. This mirror GITHUB repository will maintain updated versions of dataset.
